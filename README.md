# Online CV for César Gutiérrez
Hi! This is the GitHub page for my online CV.
You can access it clicking on [this link](https://cesar-gp.github.io/).

## Who am I?
Well, I'm a sociologist and social media manager who's also interested in programming and UX design. Oh, and I'm from Spain.

You can read more about me on the website... there's even a subpage called "About Me" 🤯🤯🤯.

## What am I doing here?
Mostly, an experiment. But also researching a way to put more information in my CV without expanding it to more than one page.

## Can I help?
I doubt anyone will ever ask that. But if you do, thanks! 😍

This is a personal project, but you can help giving feedback about your experience browsing the website, or opening an issue if you want to report a bug.

## Thanks for reading, really 😉.
